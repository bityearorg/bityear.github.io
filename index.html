                    <p>Bitcoin Maxis are very enthusiastic about the technology and sometime exaggerate it without much scientific proof. The sceptics 
                    on the other hand, miss out on the ground-breaking mathematic and cryptographic program of the Bitcoin Network. However, imagine a 
                    scenario when Bitcoin Network is loaded with $500 Trillion of investorsâ€™ money. Does Bitcoin Network stand the chance of securing so much 
                    money and if Bitcoin Network show any vulnerability in the hands of malicious actors what consequence could this have to real world financial 
                    system. A real global financial disaster, hence, government's reluctance in regulating the crypto market.

                </br>
                    <p>Because the above level has not been tested, not reached yet, it is believed, given enough resources (prox. $300M) the Bitcoin mining, 
                        and subsequently the Network itself could be compromised. We know the SHA256 is unbreakable by any means so we have completely ruled it out. 
                        The philosophy is not DDoS nor 51% attack and it will be 100% scientific. All donations will be snapshot, and participants will be part benefactors. In addition, this 
                        research will demystify Bitcoin and proven right or wrong, it will have the following outcome:</p>

                    <li>

                        <p>This is a computer science R&D dissecting Bitcoin Network. The team in charge of the experiment believe that Bitcoin mining process 
                    could be hacked with help of a layered software and an AI given that we have enough resource (prox. $300M) to buy hardware and hire expertise.</p>
                    
                    <p> In this research, we have completely ruled out 51% and DDoS attack and it is based on a completely new theoretical philosophy.
                         There is going to be much discovery along the way while we delve into this computer science research, however,
                          we wont be able to begin work without community donation.</p>
                        

                        <p>All contributions to this research will be snapshot and participant will benefit accordingly, nevertheless, we do not
                            guarantee any conclusive outcome so please only donate an amount that you can afford perhaps as much as a $5 bucks. If

                        <p>We may extend our research into other proof and consensus mechanism such as Proof of Stake, Zero Knowledge crypto, etc. In 
                            addition, there is a plan to employ AI software in these to optimise our overall work.
